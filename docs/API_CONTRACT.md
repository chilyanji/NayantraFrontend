# API contract taken from FrontendCopy.zip

`BASE` is `VITE_API_URL` (default `/api`), optionally overridden in Settings. IDs/references are percent-encoded; query parameters use URLSearchParams. Protected calls use the current session's bearer token. A 401 from that same session signs the user out; a late 401 from a previous session cannot erase the newer session.

## Identity semantics

A detection with `decided:false` is not placed in either identity list. An explicit enrolled/auto/blacklisted status takes precedence over a legacy `matched` flag. Only `recognition_confidence` is displayed as face similarity. The generic detector `confidence` is never substituted. `external_reference`, subject code, roll number, and the PyQt detection's `person_id` can serve as references; do not confuse monitored subjects with login accounts.

## Entry register fields

The table preserves: external reference, name, branch, auth status, visit_count, first_entry, last_entry, last_camera, total_seconds, has_profile_flag. It also marks on_camera_now. Period values are exactly `today`, `yesterday`, `week`, `month`, `all`. Status filter values are exactly `authorised`, `unauthorised`, `blacklisted`; they differ intentionally from subject auth_status values `enrolled`, `auto`, `blacklisted`.

## Real-time behavior

- Current detections: every 3 seconds; health/status: every 5 seconds; camera and member directory lists: every 30 seconds.
- Entry register: every 10 seconds and after relevant WebSocket messages. Requests within a single resource are not allowed to overlap; route/filter changes abort obsolete work.
- Polling is suspended while the tab is hidden and resumes on visibility. Camera streams are also disconnected while hidden. WebSocket remains open to receive alerts.
- WebSocket reconnects with capped exponential backoff and jitter. An explicit policy/auth close disables reconnect attempts for that session while REST remains available to validate access.
- Closing a dialog/page or signing out releases its requests, timers, stream readers, blob URLs, and socket. A user-initiated mutation may already have reached the server; closing its view does not promise to undo it.

## Unavailable contracts

The PyQt helpers `get_all_users`, `log_activity`, `get_recent_activity`, `get_recent_events`, `add_event`, and seed helpers contain no operational backend implementation. `/persons` and `/alerts/recent` are explicitly described as not implemented in the upload and are not needed by the active migrated workflows. Historical routes from the React references can be enabled via environment variables only when the server supports them. Reference 1's temporary/local permission grants are not a substitute for backend authorization.

The frontend cannot resolve a server that lacks a route, an unreachable database, camera/model startup failures, or an unavailable Redis publisher. It reports those conditions instead of inventing data.
