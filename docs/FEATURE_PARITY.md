# Migration and reference analysis

The source of truth is the newly provided `FrontendCopy.zip`, not an older repaired project archive. The unavailable `SentinelSurvillanceSystem - Copy03.zip` was not read or used.

| Activity/events text areas               | Activity tabs                    | Live session messages work. Historical views explicitly disclose the original helpers' lack of wiring; optional reference routes are configurable.                               |

## What is taken from each React reference

**New Frontend (1):** persistent sidebar/workspace grouping, clearer separation of role-specific navigation, account directory and permission dialog organization, reusable status cards and section headers. Its localStorage permission simulations and extra security-role assumptions were not promoted to backend capabilities.

**New Frontend 2:** camera-first workspace, grid/focus controls, quick member/profile access, a quieter status bar, notification navigation, and connection testing/settings. Its offline-generated people, fabricated camera counts, fake historical events, misleading always-live badges, and decorative mute controls were removed.

**Unified design:** bundled Inter font; navy navigation, light neutral content and blue primary actions; green/amber/red only for meaningful states; consistent spacing, borders, inputs, tables and dialogs. Dark theme, mobile navigation, keyboard focus, labelled inputs, native focus-trapped dialogs, skip navigation, reduced-motion support, and explicit loading/error/empty states are shared across pages.

## Scope boundaries

Only React/frontend source, frontend configuration, a production build, tests, and setup documentation are delivered. The backend is untouched. Database/cloud/Redis operations continue through existing services; this project includes no database client or backend business logic.

The upload exposes two roles: admin and member. The React reference's additional security-personnel role and temporary-permission administration lack a matching contract in this main frontend. Implementing them as real authorization would require backend confirmation; browser-local permissions would not preserve security.

The current desktop source's activity/events helpers are placeholders, not functioning history integrations. No functionality is claimed for those unimplemented server capabilities. Existing live events and entry history remain implemented.
